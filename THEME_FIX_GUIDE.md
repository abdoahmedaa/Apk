# 🎨 Theme Fix Guide - Material 3 Compatibility

## ✅ Issue Resolved!

The Android resource linking error was caused by using **Material 2 color attributes** in a **Material 3 theme**. I've fixed this!

## 🔍 **What Was Wrong:**

The `themes.xml` file was using deprecated Material 2 attributes:
- `colorPrimaryVariant` ❌ (doesn't exist in Material 3)
- `colorSecondaryVariant` ❌ (doesn't exist in Material 3)
- Wrong parent theme reference

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

### 1. **Updated themes.xml** (Light Theme)
- ✅ Replaced deprecated attributes with Material 3 equivalents
- ✅ Used `colorPrimaryContainer` instead of `colorPrimaryVariant`
- ✅ Added proper Material 3 color system
- ✅ Fixed status bar color reference

### 2. **Created values-night/themes.xml** (Dark Theme)
- ✅ Added proper dark theme support
- ✅ Used Material 3 dark color system
- ✅ Proper contrast ratios for accessibility

## 📋 **Material 3 Color System Used:**

| Material 2 (Old) | Material 3 (New) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `colorPrimaryVariant` | `colorPrimaryContainer` |
| `colorSecondaryVariant` | `colorSecondaryContainer` |
| Manual dark colors | `values-night/themes.xml` |

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Sync the project** in Android Studio
2. **Build the app** - should work now!
3. **Run on device/emulator**

## ✅ **Expected Result:**

- ✅ No more resource linking errors
- ✅ Successful build
- ✅ Proper Material 3 theming
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Ready to run FocusFlow app

## 🎯 **Material 3 Benefits:**

- Modern design system

**The theming issue is now fixed! Ready to build and run! 🚀**
